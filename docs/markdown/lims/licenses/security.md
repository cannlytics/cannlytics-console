# Security

The Cannlytics team takes the security of Cannlytics and the applications created with it seriously. This page describes how to report any vulnerabilities that you may find and lists best practices to minimize the risk of introducing a vulnerability.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

In the event that you find a vulnerability in Cannlytics itself, contact us through <https://cannlytics.com/contact>. For more information about how Cannlytics handles security issues, see Cannlytics' [security philosophy](https://cannlytics.com/philosophy#security).

## Best practices

Keep current with the latest Cannlytics releases. We regularly update Cannlytics, and these updates may fix security defects discovered in previous versions. Check the Cannlytics change log for security-related updates.

Keep your application's dependencies up to date. Avoid pinning to specific versions for your dependencies and, if you do, make sure that you check periodically to see if your dependencies have had security updates, and update the package accordingly.

## Macaroons

Bearer tokens -> expiry and revocation lists.
