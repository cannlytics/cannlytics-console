# Machine Learning

In a nutshell, machine learning uses data to make predictions. The process is building a model from the data and using the model to make predictions.

""learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules"

- **Loss functions** measure the guessed answers against the known correct answers, measuring how well the model fits.

- **Optimizer functions** make guesses based on the loss function's results, trying to minimize the loss.


## Model Training

By the time the training is done, the loss should be small, demonstrating that the model is doing well in inferring the relationship between the data.

"The idea is to have one set of data for training and another set of data that the model hasn't yet encountered to see how well it can classify values." help generalizing its knowledge.


## Model evaluation

Accuracy measuers how accurate the model is in classifying the training data.


## Predicting the probability of analysis failure

An interesting use for machine learning is to predict the probability that a sample will fail a given analysis, such as residual solvent, microbe, mycotoxin, heavy metal, or pesticide screening.


## Identification of Suspect Lab Results

Cannlytics uses a powerful machine learning algorithm to identify lab results suspected of being falsified. Any evidence of criminal activity stored in the Cannlytics system will be provided to law enforcement officials.


## Recommendations

Cannlytics can provide recommendations to producers and processors on how they may be able to improve cannabinoid concentrations and lower the concentration of any contaminants, such as residual solvents, microbes, mycotoxins, pesticides, and heavy metals.


## Neural Network

"Neural networks deal with probabilities"

"train a neural network to spot the relationship between two sets of numbers by defining the network"

"The collection of a network, loss function, and optimizer handles the process of guessing the relationship between the numbers, measuring how well they did, and then generating new parameters for new guesses."

Classification: Sativa, Hybrid, or Indica.

## Machine Learning Ideas

Below is a running list of machine learning ideas:

- Estimate the turnaround time of analysis, given factors such as analyses requested and sample type.
- Notify analysts of projects that may exceed a set warning turnaround time threshold.
