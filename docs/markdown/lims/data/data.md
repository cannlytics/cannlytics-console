# Data

Everyone has strong feelings about their data. Therefore, Cannlytics aims to empower you with complete control over your data. You are welcome to use any data architecture or schemas that you desire.

Cannlytics supports the **archive everything** movement. You can archive all of your laboratory data with the click of a button. Your data belongs to you and you can backup your data regularly.

Archived data is cheap, but can prove invaluable when needed.

Server or serverless.

By default, data is aggregated into a NoSQL database. This is a cheap, flexible, extensive, adaptable, and simple way to manage data. You may seek to substitute or supplement the NoSQL database with an SQL database if you wish to utilize SQL queries. However, the NoSQL database will serve you well for laboratory operations and report generation. The NoSQL database is also approachable to new developers, non-technical administrators, and analysts who need access to data.

The NoSQL database is cloud-based, allowing for easy access to the data from any where. You are always welcome to backup files and data to your server with easy data exporting.

Ultimately, you need the ability to collect results from your instruments, generate certificates of analysis (CoAs) with the results, and then deliver the CoAs to your clients.

The Cannlytics engine provides you with a simple setup, collects results from your instruments, presents the results to your team for processing, allows you to build custom CoAs, and then issue the CoAs to clients through email or a client portal.

Collecting results from instruments is often a challenge for labs of all sizes. As there are many moving pieces, the Cannlytics system makes your life easier by aggregating sample results.
