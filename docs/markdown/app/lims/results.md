# Results

## Posting Results

There are several places where you may wish to post lab results, including:

* A state traceability system.
* A cloud database.
* A client's software system.
* A public data warehouse.

Cannlytics can facilitate posting lab results wherever they need to go.

* OpenTHC

## Results API

Certain developers may wish to *pull* results rather than have results *posted* to them. For this, you can use the Cannlytics API to facilitate lab result access.
