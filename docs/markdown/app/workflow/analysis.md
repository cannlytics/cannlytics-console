# Analysis

Analyses represent scientific tests, such as cannabinoid analysis and pesticide screening. An analysis may contain multiple analytes, specific compound or substances that are being measured.

## Analytes

An analyte is a specific measurement, such as the concentration of THCA, CBDV, or piperonyl butoxide. An analyte can have many supporting fields, such as lowest order of detection (LOD), lowest order of quantification (LOQ), regulatory limit and more.
