# The story of the Cannlytics Consumer

As a cannabis consumer, it is important to track your cannabis consumption. It is important to know the amount of cannabis that you consume, both in weight and cannabinoid content, and the amount spent on the cannabis consumed.

## The Voynich manuscript

The motivation of the Cannlytics Consumer is the [Voynich manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript), a yet-to-be-decoded cryptic manuscript that may be a secret guide to cannabis consumption. Of unknown authorship, the book was sold for many ounces of gold and handed down from emperors throughout history.
