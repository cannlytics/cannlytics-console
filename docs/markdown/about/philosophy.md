# Philosophy

Users are encouraged to have their own kit of Cannlytics, since Cannlytics is a set of helpful tools that can empower your cannabis testing lab.

A good idea should be easy and simple to explain. Therefore, Cannlytics strives to provide software that makes cannabis testing easy by making data collection and certificate of analysis creation easy.

Programming is for everyone. Everyone should be able to contribute to or modify their laboratory software, if they desire. Analysts, chemists, marketers, and managers should all be empowered to explore, tinker, adapt, and improve their LIMS.

A primary purpose of the Cannlytics engine is to make your data accessible. You should be able to understand your laboratory software, how it collects result, and how results are stored. You can inspect what the Cannlytics engine is doing at every step of the way to keep you empowered with how your lab tests cannabis.

## Value for value
