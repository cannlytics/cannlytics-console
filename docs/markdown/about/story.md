## Website Creation

In October of 2020, a sole developer, Keegan Skeate, undertook the crafting of the Cannlytics Website to launch the Cannlytics Engine. I would like to help people access lab data easier in the lab, for the lab's clients, for the retailers of the clients, and for the end consumers.


<!-- My mission is help connect people to their laboratory data. From the time data is generated from a scientific instrument, there is a long pipeline to get the data to the end consumer.

In a nutshell, the data is often transcribed by a lab analyst, entered into an Excel spreadsheet, funneled into a database, looked at by multiple people, put on a certificate, then emailed or delivered through a portal to the client. The client, a wholesaler, then has to relay the certificate to their retailers. By this point, the chain is so convoluted that consumer's can not quickly review actual lab results.

So, there is interesting and potentially valuable lab data at different bottlenecks, but poor system communication often renders it useless. I would like to help people access lab data easier in the lab, for the lab's clients, for the retailers of the clients, and for the end consumers. -->
