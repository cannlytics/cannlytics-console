# Philosophy

- Simple is better than complex.
- Now is better than never.
- There should be one, and preferably only one, way to do something. Although that something depends on the situation at hand.
- Beauty is a virtue.
- Code is read more often than it is written, so readability matters.
- The top 3 rules of coding are: reuse, reuse, reuse.
- The number 1 rule of data science is look at the data.
- Never throw away data.
- The tortoise beats the hare.
- Don't repeat yourself.

Users are encouraged to have their own kit of Cannlytics, since Cannlytics is a set of helpful tools that can empower your cannabis testing lab.

A good idea should be easy and simple to explain. Therefore, Cannlytics strives to provide software that makes cannabis testing easy by making data collection and certificate of analysis creation easy.

Programming is for everyone. Everyone should be able to contribute to or modify their laboratory software, if they desire. Analysts, chemists, marketers, and managers should all be empowered to explore, tinker, adapt, and improve their LIMS.

A primary purpose of the Cannlytics engine is to make your data accessible. You should be able to understand your laboratory software, how it collects result, and how results are stored. You can inspect what the Cannlytics engine is doing at every step of the way to keep you empowered with how your lab tests cannabis.

## Value for value

## Transparency

Part of the scientific process is presenting your methods to show how you reached your conclusion. Cannlytics takes cannabis testing transparency to the next level, presenting all software for your clients and the public to judge its robustness. At Cannlytics, we believe that if your process is solid, then it should withstand scrutiny. Furthermore, transparency ensures that system security is secure by design.

## Why Python?

Data science and AI. Ultimately technology is 

Really easy to learn.
Approachable

Really easy to install. Installed by default on newer machines.

Easy to read. Reads like english.


Fast speed of write time.


The faster you get the app out the better, because development is an iterative process.

Versatility:

- Automation
- Web development
- App development

The Python core allows for lab teams to build custom workflows directly in the Cannlytics engine.
