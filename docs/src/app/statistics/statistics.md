# Statistics

Cannlytics implements a wide array of statistical tools that you can utilize. Import your data or integrate your data stream, then select the variables you want to analyze and how you want to analyze them.

## Experimental modelling

When you have an outcome that you are trying to predict, then you can utilize several models.

### Probit models

We notice that the differences in the estimated coefficients of the ML probit model compared to those of the NLLS probit model are much larger. If you believe that you may have measurement error, then you may opt for a NLLS probit because while the NLLS probit is not efficient, it is more robust to outliers.
