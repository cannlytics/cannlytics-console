The best way to get started is to [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), then you can begin to review the architecture and code in earnest to get a lay of the land and find a way to contribute. You can reach out to <dev@cannlytics.com> or look at the current issues on Github to get an idea for a contribution that will be particularly valuable. You are more than welcome to dive in, start tinkering, and discover a way to contribute on your own if you prefer.

You can read the development guides ([App](https://docs.cannlytics.com/app/development), [API](https://docs.cannlytics.com/api/development), [SDK](https://docs.cannlytics.com/sdk/development)) to get an idea of how to build various apps in the Cannlytics platform. You can also install the [Cannlytics Python SDK](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics-engine) to work with Cannlytics' core functionality directly.

```py
pip install cannlytics
```

## Art
